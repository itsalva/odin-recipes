# odin-recipes

For my first project on The Odin Project, I am tasked with creating a basic recipe website which has a main index page that contains links to a few recipes. This project tests the basics of HTML, using links, images, lists, etc.

Once I finish The Odin Project I intend to rework the code of this project.
